  </div>        <p>
            We plan on expanding GlasgowGigs to the whole of Scotland. Our aim is to let artists have control over where and how
            they play their gigs, as well as edit their own pages and information to reach out to their fans. We also aim to let
            venues edit their own pages in terms of recent photos as well as information.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-purple w3-padding-16">Who are we?</h3>
  </div>        <p>This website was created by Daniela, Martina and Julia. We are three 2nd year students studying Computer Science at the University of Glasgow.
    Our common interest in both Web Programming and Music formed the idea of creating GlasgowGigs as we all noticed that there
    is no easy platform for music fans in Glasgow to find all the upcoming gigs for local music, as well as a collective website
    that has information on Glaswegian artists and venues.
